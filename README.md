## A few words to say

🎉 The default component is written for my personal use. So maybe you need to
create your own component. I'm very happy to see your component. So if you have
any idea to create a new component, please open an issue or pull request.

### Concept ideas

- I like the reference concept in any database structure based on id. So I use the same concept in this plugin for component system. You can reference other component by id to share some field like events, style, static, context, hide, min_screen_width. This will help you to create a component based on other component without duplicate code.

- This plugin also support inherit field from parent by recursively. So you can create a component based on other component and override some field like [heirline](https://github.com/rebelot/heirline.nvim). But I think the reference concept is better than inherit concept because you can share some field between components. And the statusline is a flat structure so you don't need to create a nested structure like heirline.

## ✨ Features

`witch-line` is a fast, lightweight, and fully customizable statusline plugin for Neovim. It focuses on modularity, caching, and performance. Below are the key features:

- ⚡ **Blazing Fast**: Optimized with internal caching and minimal redraws to keep your statusline snappy and efficient. Just config for first time and **every thing** will be cache and run super fast later.

- 🧩 **Modular Components**: Define reusable and nested components using a simple configuration format.

- 🎛 **Abstract Components**: Support for abstract components that can be composed and reused without rendering directly.

- 🎨 **Flexible Layouts**: Arrange statusline components in any order, across multiple layers or segments.

- 🔁 **Reactive Updates**: Smart detection of buffer/file changes to update only when necessary.

- 📁 **Context-Aware Disabling**: Automatically disable the statusline for specific `filetypes` or `buftypes` (e.g. terminal, help, etc).

- 🧠 **Config Hashing**: Detect if user config has changed via FNV-1a hashing, ensuring minimal reinitialization.

- 💾 **Persistent Caching**: Cache user configurations and state across sessions using a simple key-value system.

- 🧪 **Testable & Maintainable**: Designed with testability and clear API boundaries in mind.

- 🛠 **Extensible**: Easily extend with custom components.

This plugin is ideal for developers who want full control over the look and feel of their statusline, without sacrificing performance or flexibility.

## Installation

```lua
    -- lazy
    {
        "sontungexpt/witch-line",
        dependencies = {
            "nvim-tree/nvim-web-devicons",
        },
        lazy = false, -- Almost component is lazy load by default. So you can set lazy to false
        opts = {},
    },
```

## Usage

### Laststatus

You should set `laststatus` by yourself. I recommend you set `laststatus` to `3` to be better.

```lua
vim.o.laststatus = 3
```

### Options

You can setup the plugin by calling the `setup` function and passing in a table of options.

```lua

require("witch-line").setup({
  --- @type CombinedComponent[]
  abstract = {
    "file.name",
    {
      id = "file", -- Abstract component for file-related info
      padding = { left = 1, right = 1 }, -- Padding around the component
      static = { some_key = "some_value" }, -- Static metadata
      style = { fg = "#ffffff", bg = "#000000", bold = true }, -- Style override
      min_screen_width = 80,          -- Hide if screen width < 80
    },
  },
  --- @type CombinedComponent[]
  components = {
    "mode",
    "file.name",
    "file.icon",
    {
      id = "component_id",               -- Unique identifier
      padding = { left = 1, right = 1 }, -- Padding around the component
      static = { some_key = "some_value" }, -- Static metadata
      timing = false,                 -- No timing updates
      style = { fg = "#ffffff", bg = "#000000", bold = true }, -- Style override
      min_screen_width = 80,          -- Hide if screen width < 80
      hidden = function()               -- Hide condition
        return vim.bo.buftype == "nofile"
      end,
      left_style = { fg = "#ff0000" }, -- Left style override
      update = function(self, ctx, static, session_id) -- Main content generator
        return vim.fn.expand("%:t")
      end,
      ref = {                       -- References to other components
        events = { "file.name" },
        style = "file.name",
        static = "file.name",
      },
    },
  },
  disabled = {
    filetypes = { "help", "TelescopePrompt" },
    buftypes = { "nofile", "terminal" },
  },
})

```

### ⚙️ Customizable Fields for Default Components

Each component accepts a set of customization fields to control its behavior, style, visibility, and layout.

Below is a table of all supported fields and their expected types:

| Field              | Type(s)               | Description                                                                       |
| ------------------ | --------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `padding`          | `number`, `table`     | Adds padding around the component. Can be a single number or `{ left, right }`.   |
| `static`           | `any`                 | Any static value or metadata the component wants to keep.                         |
| `timing`           | `boolean`, `number`   | Enables timing or sets a custom update interval for the component.                |
| `style`            | `function`, `table`   | Style override for the entire component output (e.g., color, bold).               |
| `min_screen_width` | `number`              | Hides the component if the screen width is below this threshold.                  |
| `hidden`           | `function`, `boolean` | Hide condition. If `true` or a function that returns `true`, hides the component. |
| `left_style`       | `function`, `table`   | Style override applied to the left part of the component.                         |
| `left`             | `string`, `function`  | Left content to be rendered. Can be a string or a generator function.             |
| `right_style`      | `function`, `table`   | Style override applied to the right part of the component.                        |
| `right`            | `string`, `function`  | Right content to be rendered. Can be a string or a generator function.            |
| `flexible`         | `number`              | Priority for hiding when space is limited. Lower numbers hide first.              |

---

You can use the `require("witch-line.builtin").comp` builtin function to create a customized version of any default component by specifying overrides for these fields.

```lua

local my_component = require("witch-line.builtin").comp("file.name", {
  padding = { left = 2 },
  min_screen_width = 60,
  hide = function()
    return vim.bo.buftype == "nofile"
  end,
  style = { fg = "#ffffff", bg = "#222222", bold = true },
})
```

Or you can also use the [0] field to override the default component.

```lua
local my_component = {
  [0] = "file.name",  -- Inherit from the default file.name component
  padding = { left = 2 },
  min_screen_width = 60,
  hide = function()
    return vim.bo.buftype == "nofile"
  end,
  style = { fg = "#ffffff", bg = "#222222", bold = true },
}
```
