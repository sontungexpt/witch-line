## A few words to say

üéâ The default component is written for my personal use. So maybe you need to
create your own component. I'm very happy to see your component. So if you have
any idea to create a new component, please open an issue or pull request.

## ‚ú® Features

`witch-line` is a fast, lightweight, and fully customizable statusline plugin for Neovim. It focuses on modularity, caching, and performance. Below are the key features:

- ‚ö° **Blazing Fast**: Optimized with internal caching and minimal redraws to keep your statusline snappy and efficient. Just config for first time and **every thing** will be cache and run super fast  later.

- üß© **Modular Components**: Define reusable and nested components using a simple configuration format.

- üéõ **Abstract Components**: Support for abstract components that can be composed and reused without rendering directly.

- üé® **Flexible Layouts**: Arrange statusline components in any order, across multiple layers or segments.

- üîÅ **Reactive Updates**: Smart detection of buffer/file changes to update only when necessary.

- üìÅ **Context-Aware Disabling**: Automatically disable the statusline for specific `filetypes` or `buftypes` (e.g. terminal, help, etc).

- üß† **Config Hashing**: Detect if user config has changed via FNV-1a hashing, ensuring minimal reinitialization.

- üíæ **Persistent Caching**: Cache user configurations and state across sessions using a simple key-value system.

- üß™ **Testable &  Maintainable**: Designed with testability and clear API boundaries in mind.

- üõ† **Extensible**: Easily extend with custom components.

This plugin is ideal for developers who want full control over the look and feel of their statusline, without sacrificing performance or flexibility.


## Installation

```lua
    -- lazy
    {
        "sontungexpt/witch-line",
        dependencies = {
            "nvim-tree/nvim-web-devicons",
        },
        event = { "BufEnter" },
        config = function(_, opts)
            require("sttusline").setup()
        end,
    },
```

## Options

```lua

require("witch-line").setup({
  components = {
     "mode" ,
     "file.name", 
     "file.icon",
  },
  disabled = {
    filetypes = { "help", "TelescopePrompt" },
    buftypes = { "nofile", "terminal" },
  },
})

```

## Usage

### Laststatus

You should set `laststatus` by yourself. I recommend you set `laststatus` to `3` to be better.

```lua
vim.opt.laststatus = 3
```

### Components

### üîó Ref Table Subfields

The `ref` field supports the following subfields for deferred configuration:

- `events`
- `user_events`
- `timing`
- `style`
- `static`
- `context`
- `min_screen_width`
- `hide`

These allow reusing logic/configuration between components or lazily loading behavior.

### üìö Example

```lua
{
  id = "mode",
  events = { "ModeChanged" },
  update = function()
    return vim.fn.mode()
  end,
  style = { fg = "#ffffff", bg = "#005f87", bold = true },
  padding = { left = 1, right = 1 },
  hide = function()
    return vim.bo.filetype == "NvimTree"
  end,
}.

## üôå Community Help & Contributions Wanted

`witch-line` is a flexible and powerful statusline plugin for Neovim, but there's still a lot of room to improve and grow. I'm actively seeking help and contributions from the community to make this project even better.

Here are a few areas where your help would be especially appreciated:

- üìò **API Documentation**  
  Help rewrite and polish the API reference into clear and professional documentation. Better docs will make it easier for others to build powerful custom setups.

- üß¨ **Serialization System**  
  Design and implement a robust system to serialize and deserialize component configurations. This would help cache system worj better

- üß™ **Component Testing Framework**  
  Improve or design an ergonomic and declarative way to test components individually and ensure they behave consistently in different contexts.

- üì¶ **Plugin Ecosystem**  
  You can create new plugin extensions built on top of `witch-line`‚Äîsuch as battery indicators, LSP diagnostics, Git integrations, and more.

- üí° **Ideas, Feedback, and Bug Reports**  
  Even if you‚Äôre not a coder, suggestions, feedback, and bug reports are very welcome.

If you‚Äôre interested in helping, feel free to open an issue, start a discussion, or submit a PR. Let's build something awesome together. üôè
